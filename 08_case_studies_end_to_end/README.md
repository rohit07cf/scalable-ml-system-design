# Case Studies: End-to-End

## What This Section Covers

- Full system designs for LLM-powered products, from requirements to deployment
- Integration of retrieval, generation, evaluation, and serving into cohesive architectures
- Enterprise-grade concerns: access control, compliance, multi-tenancy, cost management
- Patterns that recur across real-world AI products and how to adapt them


## What Interviewers Usually Test

- Can you drive a design from vague product requirements to a concrete, deployable architecture?
- Do you address cross-cutting concerns (latency, cost, safety, observability) without being prompted?
- Can you make and defend trade-off decisions under real-world constraints?


## Suggested Study Order

1. `design_enterprise_chatbot` -- foundational conversational AI patterns
2. `design_large_doc_summarization` -- long-context processing and chunking strategies
3. `design_ai_research_assistant` -- multi-step reasoning and tool use
4. `design_ai_code_assistant` -- code-specific retrieval, generation, and evaluation
5. `design_enterprise_knowledge_copilot` -- ties together RAG, agents, and enterprise constraints


## Fast Revision Path

- Review the "must explain in interview" bullets across all five designs
- For each design, be ready to sketch the data flow from user input to final output
- Focus on trade-offs: every design has at least three you should be able to discuss cold
