# Use Case Template -- 7-Phase Approach

A structured template for walking through an ML system design problem from requirements to wrap-up.


## Overview

This template breaks a system design answer into seven sequential phases:

1. Requirements
2. Estimation
3. API Design
4. High-Level Design
5. Database Design
6. Deep Dives
7. Wrap-Up

Each phase has its own file with section headings and guidance bullets. Fill in each section with concise, problem-specific content.


## When to Use

- Full end-to-end ML system design interview questions (45--60 minutes)
- Practice sessions where you want to simulate a realistic interview flow
- Study notes for a specific use case you want to commit to memory
