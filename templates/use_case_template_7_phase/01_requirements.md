# Phase 1 -- Requirements


## Functional Requirements

- List the core user-facing capabilities the system must support
- State what the ML model needs to predict, rank, or generate
- Identify the primary input and output for each capability


## Non-Functional Requirements

- Define latency targets (e.g., p50, p99) for online serving
- State throughput expectations (requests per second, batch size)
- Note availability and consistency requirements


## Constraints

- Identify hard limits: budget, team size, timeline, regulatory
- Call out any data restrictions (privacy, retention, geography)
- Note infrastructure constraints (on-prem vs. cloud, GPU availability)


## Assumptions

- State what you are assuming about user behavior and traffic patterns
- Clarify any ambiguous parts of the problem you are choosing to scope in or out
- Document assumptions about data availability and quality
