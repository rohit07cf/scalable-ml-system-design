# Interview Walkthrough


## Opening Statement

- Start with a one-sentence summary of what this component does and why it matters
- State the scope: what you will cover and what you are intentionally leaving out
- Mention the key design goal (e.g., low latency, high throughput, extensibility)


## Key Decisions to Highlight

- Identify 2-3 design decisions that show depth of thinking
- For each, briefly state the decision, the alternatives, and why you chose this path
- Connect each decision back to a requirement or constraint


## Common Follow-up Questions

- "How would this change if traffic increased 10x?"
- "What happens when this component fails -- how do callers handle it?"
- "How would you test this in isolation?"
