# LLD Template -- Low-Level Design

A structured template for diving deep into a single component or subsystem.


## Overview

This template covers the detailed design of one component, from entity modeling through class diagrams to implementation stubs. It contains seven files:

1. HLD-to-LLD Mapping
2. Core Entities
3. Key Interfaces
4. Design Patterns Used
5. Class Diagram
6. Implementation (Python skeleton)
7. Interview Walkthrough


## When to Use

- When an interviewer asks you to "zoom in" on a specific component
- When practicing detailed design of a feature store, model server, ranking service, or similar subsystem
- When you want to prepare a polished deep-dive segment for a 15--20 minute portion of an interview
