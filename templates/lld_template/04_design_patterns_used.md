# Design Patterns Used


## Patterns Applied

- List each design pattern used in this component (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Observer)
- State where in the component each pattern is applied
- Keep the list to 2-4 patterns; more suggests over-engineering


## Why Each Pattern

- For each pattern, state the specific problem it solves in one sentence
- Explain what would be harder or messier without it
- Reference the interface or class where it is most visible


## Alternatives Considered

- For each pattern, name one alternative approach you rejected
- State why the chosen pattern is a better fit for this context
- Note any trade-offs introduced by the chosen pattern (complexity, indirection)
