# Core Entities


## Entity List

- List each entity with its name and a one-line description
- Include key attributes and their data types
- Note which entities are persisted vs. transient


## Relationships

- Describe relationships between entities (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Note ownership and cascade behavior on deletion
- Identify any circular dependencies and how they are resolved


## Lifecycle

- Describe the state transitions for the primary entity (e.g., created, processing, completed, failed)
- Note who or what triggers each transition
- Identify cleanup or archival rules for terminal states
