# Class Diagram


## Core Classes

- List each class with its name and single responsibility
- Note the 2-3 most important methods on each class
- Indicate which classes are abstract or interfaces


## Relationships

- Describe inheritance hierarchies (keep them shallow, prefer composition)
- Note composition and aggregation relationships
- Identify dependency injection points


## Notes

- Keep the diagram to 5-8 classes; focus on the critical path
- Use a simple notation (UML or boxes-and-arrows) that you can reproduce on a whiteboard
- Call out any classes that are likely to change frequently and why
