# Diagrams Template

Guidance on what diagrams to prepare and how to draw them effectively in interviews.


## Diagram Types to Prepare

- System context diagram -- shows your system as a box with external actors and data flows
- Component diagram -- shows internal services, stores, and queues with their connections
- Sequence diagram -- shows the request lifecycle through components for one key flow
- Data flow diagram -- shows how data moves from ingestion through processing to serving


## Tools to Use

- Excalidraw or draw.io for practice diagrams you want to save and refine
- Plain pen and paper (or whiteboard) for timed practice to build speed


## Tips for Whiteboard Diagrams

- Draw boxes for components first, then add arrows; label every arrow with what flows through it
- Keep the diagram to 6-10 boxes; if you need more, you are probably mixing levels of abstraction
- Use consistent notation: solid arrows for synchronous calls, dashed arrows for asynchronous messages
